# Visual Regression Tracker
Open source, self hosted solution for visual testing and managing results of visual testing. 

## How it works
Service receives images, performs pixel by pixel comparison with itâ€™s previously accepted baseline and provides immediate results in order to catch unexpected changes. 

## Geting started guide
* [Playwright](https://github.com/Visual-Regression-Tracker/Visual-Regression-Tracker/wiki/Getting-started-with-Playwright)
* [Storybook](https://github.com/Visual-Regression-Tracker/Visual-Regression-Tracker/wiki/Storybook)

## Features
* Automation framework independent - no need to stick with specifit automation tool, integrate with existiong one
* Platform independend - web, mobile, desktop etc. as long as you could make a screenshot
* Baseline history - track how baseline image changed since the beginning
* Ignore regions - improve stability by ignoring not important or not controllable parts of image
* Language support: JS, Java or any other via REST API (need more?)
* Easy setup - everything is inside Docker images
* Self-hosted - keep your data save inside your intranet

## Glossary
* TestVariation - unique identifier for Baseline, consists of Name + OS + Browser + Viewport
* Baseline - validated and accepted image, latest baseline will be used as expected result in TestRun
* TestRun - result of comparing image against Baseline
* Build - list of TestRuns
* Project - list of Builds and TestVariations

## Set up
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
1. Copy [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Visual-Regression-Tracker/Visual-Regression-Tracker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and [.env](https://github.com/Visual-Regression-Tracker/Visual-Regression-Tracker/blob/master/.env) in one folder
1. Create folder for images `imageUploads`
1. `$ docker-compose up`
1. open http://localhost:8080
1. Login with default user: `visual-regression-tracker@example.com/123456` and copy it's `apiKey`
1. Create a new project and copy it's `projectId`
1. See blow `Integration examples` how to send data to the service

### Integration
Use implemented libraries to integrate with existing automated suites by adding assertions based on image comparison.
We provide native integration with automation libraries, core SDK and Rest API interfaces that allow the system to be used with any existing programming language.

## Native integration
* [Playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@visual-regression-tracker/agent-playwright)

## Core SDK
Basic wrapper over API to be used for integration with existing tools
* [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@visual-regression-tracker/sdk-js)
* [Java](https://github.com/Visual-Regression-Tracker/sdk-java)

## Integration examples
Here you could find examples 
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/Visual-Regression-Tracker/vrt-examples-js) - Playwright, core SDK
* [Java](https://github.com/Visual-Regression-Tracker/examples-java) - Selenium WebDriver

## Contribution
